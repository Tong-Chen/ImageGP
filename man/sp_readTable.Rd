\usage{
sp_readTable(
  file,
  sep = "\\t",
  row.names = NULL,
  header = T,
  quote = "",
  comment = "",
  check.names = F,
  renameDuplicateRowNames = F
)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{the name of the file which the data are to be read from.
    Each row of the table appears as one line of the file.  If it does
    not contain an \emph{absolute} path, the file name is
    \emph{relative} to the current working directory,
    \code{\link{getwd}()}. Tilde-expansion is performed where supported.
    This can be a compressed file (see \code{\link{file}}).

    Alternatively, \code{file} can be a readable text-mode
    \link{connection} (which will be opened for reading if
    necessary, and if so \code{\link{close}}d (and hence destroyed) at
    the end of the function call).  (If \code{\link{stdin}()} is used,
    the prompts for lines may be somewhat confusing.  Terminate input
    with a blank line or an EOF signal, \code{Ctrl-D} on Unix and
    \code{Ctrl-Z} on Windows.  Any pushback on \code{stdin()} will be
    cleared before return.)

    \code{file} can also be a complete URL.  (For the supported URL
    schemes, see the \sQuote{URLs} section of the help for
    \code{\link{url}}.)
  }

\item{sep}{the field separator character.  Values on each line of the
    file are separated by this character.  If \code{sep = ""} (the
    default for \code{read.table}) the separator is \sQuote{white space},
    that is one or more spaces, tabs, newlines or carriage returns.}

\item{row.names}{a vector of row names.  This can be a vector giving
    the actual row names, or a single number giving the column of the
    table which contains the row names, or character string giving the
    name of the table column containing the row names.

    If there is a header and the first row contains one fewer field than
    the number of columns, the first column in the input is used for the
    row names.  Otherwise if \code{row.names} is missing, the rows are
    numbered.

    Using \code{row.names = NULL} forces row numbering. Missing or
    \code{NULL} \code{row.names} generate row names that are considered
    to be \sQuote{automatic} (and not preserved by \code{\link{as.matrix}}).
  }

\item{header}{a logical value indicating whether the file contains the
    names of the variables as its first line.  If missing, the value is
    determined from the file format: \code{header} is set to \code{TRUE}
    if and only if the first row contains one fewer field than the
    number of columns.}

\item{quote}{the set of quoting characters. To disable quoting
    altogether, use \code{quote = ""}.  See \code{\link{scan}} for the
    behaviour on quotes embedded in quotes.  Quoting is only considered
    for columns read as character, which is all of them unless
    \code{colClasses} is specified.}

\item{check.names}{logical.  If \code{TRUE} then the names of the
    variables in the data frame are checked to ensure that they are
    syntactically valid variable names.  If necessary they are adjusted
    (by \code{\link{make.names}}) so that they are, and also to ensure
    that there are no duplicates.}

\item{renameDuplicateRowNames}{If TRUE, the function will transfer first column
as row names (with duplicates numbered)}
